This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, make sure you have docker installed on your system.

[Docker For Windows](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/windows/install/)

[Docker For Mac](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/mac/install/)

Next, go ahead and boot up the project by running the following:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

This will boot up docker and install all dependencies for the application.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

### Mongo Integration
The node mongo integration logic is located at `middleware/database.js`. In next.js, all routes under `pages/api` are server side rendered, so there's no need for us to use something like epxress. This is where we can build out the api for the project.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
